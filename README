** Description: This is a scheduler executed in Domain0 of Xen virtulized environment.
** It rebalances all VM's performance states and steals power from other VMs to GPU VM 
** to cap the maximum power consumption. This scheduler is originally used in my submitted 
** MICRO paper.The paper is rejected due to weak ideas. However, it is a nice try for a 
** python project. 
** It includes three schedulers: optimal search, evenly search and priority search.
**
** Usage: python VirtualThief.py [GPU Application Name] [Input Size] [Method] [Degradation]
